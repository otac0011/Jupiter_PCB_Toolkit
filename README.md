# Jupiter PCB Toolkit

> **Releases-only repository.** This repo hosts the prebuilt Windows installer / executable for Jupiter PCB Toolkit. The source code is proprietary and lives in a private repository.

## Get the latest release

→ **[Download the latest release](https://github.com/otac0011/Jupiter_PCB_Toolkit/releases/latest)** (Windows .exe, ~190 MB self-contained)

Open `JupiterPCBToolkit.exe`. On first launch you'll be asked to accept the End User License Agreement. No installer step — the executable is a self-contained PyInstaller bundle.

## What it does

A desktop tool for PCB engineering, ~48 calculators across:

- **Core PCB** — trace impedance (Hammerstad-Jensen / Wadell), 3D field-solver Z₀ via openEMS, current carrying (IPC-2152 + IPC-2221), fusing current, via R/L/C and stub analysis
- **Signal Integrity** — channel insertion-loss budget, jitter budget, conductor + dielectric loss with surface-roughness models, **Via Stub Impact analyzer** with 20 SerDes protocol presets and 3D sensitivity surface
- **RF / Microwave** — Pi-pad / T-pad attenuators, L / Pi / T lumped LC matching with parasitic-aware S11, multi-section λ/4 transformers (binomial + Chebyshev), Smith chart matching. Each has a **3D sensitivity-surface tolerance analysis**.
- **Power Integrity** — PDN target impedance, MLCC DC-bias derating, decap-bank Z(f) analyzer, mounting inductance
- **High-Speed Digital** — DDR length matching
- **EMC**, **Thermal**, **Mechanical / DFM**, **Filters**, **Power Electronics**, **Reference**
- A **PCB Design Wizard** that runs a 100+ candidate Pareto sweep to recommend three buildable stackups for your constraints
